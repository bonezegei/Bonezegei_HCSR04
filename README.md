# Bonezegei_HCSR04
### Arduino Library for Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

Bonezegei_HCSR04 is a simple and easy-to-use Arduino library for interfacing HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor module. The library provides functions for measuring distance, setting trigger and echo pins. The library also supports multiple sensors connected to the same Arduino board. This paper shows the basic usage of the library.
